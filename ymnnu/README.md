# You Might Not Need useEffect

![useEffect](https://www.tutorialswebsite.com/wp-content/uploads/useeffect-hooks-in-reactjs.jpg)

This project is a demonstration of how to avoid unnecessary usage of the `useEffect` hook in React. It showcases a common scenario where developers might think they need to use `useEffect` to reset a state variable when a prop changes, but there's actually a simpler and more efficient solution.

## Examples
The examples for this project are located in the `src` directory. Each part of the demonstration is in its own folder, named `part-1`, `part-2`, and so on.
